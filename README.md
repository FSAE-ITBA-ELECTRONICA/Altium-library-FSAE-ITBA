# FSAE ITBA Altium Library
Based on the Libebal Altium Library, the FSAE ITBA Altium Library is an Integrated Altium Library to be used by our FSAE team. 


The library is aimed towards Electrical Engineering students, given the fact that the students that will be using this library have at most 2 yearsâ€™ experience with Altium Designer simplicity is key, follow the KISS principal (Keep it simple, stupid). Based on this, the choice was taken to distribute as an integrated library.
